== Purpose
To provide a single, authoritative and trustworthy source for all data that is communicated about the Bisq network and client. Additionally this role is responsible to re-evalute Bisq's Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) on an on-going basis to enable measurement of success and failure in all experiments and changes to the platform.

== Motivation
Based on a https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o-I5fAx7DJRVqYjW8fPbo0ztlGIhIZ1EM2iLc5aEHnA/edit?usp=sharing[reporting sheet] by https://github.com/ripcurlx[@ripcurlx], we found out that the current numbers visualized by https://coin.dance/volume/bisq[coin.dance] and communicated by us were even better than we thought. This was the kickstarter to define and collect our most important metrics (KPIs) in a single place.
