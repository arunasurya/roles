# Blog Project

## Introduction
We are going to publish blog posts on a regular basis and would like to hear your experiences using Bisq, thoughts on the Bisq DAO and any other ideas that you would like to share with 
the Bisq community and the rest of the world. We will share your blog posts on the Bisq blog site and other blogging platforms. You will work closely with the other contributors in 
producing quality posts and be compensated for your work. 

In the spirit of the Bisq DAO, we would like to create an efficient blog writing process with the focus on the writer autonomy and fruitful collaboration. This process may change
as more writers join us. A blog project lead will coordinate the project, communicate with the writers and ensure the continuous stream of posts. The current project lead is @arunasurya.


## Blog writing process
- If you are interested, join and introduce yourself in the `blogposts` slack channel
- Review the blog writing schedule, leave a comment on your choice of the publishing week and the topic OR contact the blog project lead with these details
- The project lead will get in touch with the individual writers and work closely on the delivery of the post
- The project lead will handle the editing and publishing process. All you need to focus on is writing
- The final draft should be sent to the project lead one week prior to the publication week

Those writers who become regular contributors to the project will get edit access to the blog writing schedule. Currently, the edit access is only given to the project lead to avoid any confusion.

## Compensation
The blog writer can file a compensation request for the amount of BSQ that they think
is reasonable for their work. The compensation request is filed after the blog post has been published.
